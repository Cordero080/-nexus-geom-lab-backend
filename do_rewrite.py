    b"feat: enhance audio reactivity and add symphonic particle motion\n\nFRONTEND CHANGES:\n================\n\n\xf0\x9f\x8e\xb5 useAudioAnalyzer.js - Audio Frequency Analysis\n--------------------------------------------------\nWHAT IT DOES:\n- Analyzes real-time audio to extract frequency data (bass, mids, highs)\n- Breaks audio into frequency bands to drive visual effects\n- Normalizes audio data to 0-1 range for consistent animations\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n- Split bass into sub-bass (20-60Hz - deep kicks) and mid-bass (60-250Hz - toms/bass guitar)\n- Weighted combination: sub-bass gets 70% influence (kicks hit harder visually)\n- Sharp highs (2000-8000Hz) now focus on transient sounds (snare, hi-hat, claps)\n- Filters out sustained high frequencies to emphasize percussive hits\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. Web Audio API captures audio stream from user's microphone/audio input\n2. AnalyzerNode converts audio to frequency data using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)\n3. getFrequencyRangeAverage() samples specific Hz ranges and normalizes them\n4. Returns { bass, mids, highs, overall } object that components can use\n\nCOMMUNICATES WITH:\n- Any component that imports useAudioAnalyzer() hook\n- Drives particle systems, color changes, animations based on music\n\n\xf0\x9f\x8c\x8c useNebulaParticles.js - Symphonic Particle Motion\n-----------------------------------------------------\nWHAT IT DOES:\n- Creates 200 floating particles that move in synchronized orbital patterns\n- Divides particles into 3 groups that move like a symphony orchestra\n- Each group has unique motion choreography inspired by Beethoven's 9th Symphony\n\nTHE 3 ORCHESTRA SECTIONS:\n1. STRINGS (Group 0 - Inner Orbit):\n   - Smooth flowing melody like violins playing 'Ode to Joy'\n   - Graceful sinusoidal motion with harmonic intervals\n   - Tight 8-unit orbit with gentle vertical breathing\n   - Slightly more visible (opacity 0.2)\n\n2. BRASS (Group 1 - Middle Orbit):\n   - Bold punctuated phrases like horns and trumpets\n   - Staccato (stepped) motion with dramatic swells\n   - Wide 22-unit orbit with vertical stratification\n   - Crescendo/decrescendo opacity changes (forte/piano)\n\n3. TIMPANI (Group 2 - Outer Orbit):\n   - Rhythmic pulses like percussion heartbeat\n   - Radial bursts that expand/contract on 4/4 beat\n   - Far 40-unit orbit with accented 4th beat (boom-boom-boom-BOOM)\n   - Sharp attack/decay opacity\n\nMOTION MATHEMATICS:\n- Uses sin/cos for circular orbits and figure-8 paths\n- Phase offset (unique per particle) prevents clustering\n- Multiple frequencies combined (t * 0.25, t * 2, t * 0.5) create harmony\n- Squared sine waves (Math.pow) create dramatic crescendos\n\nRENDERING:\n- depthTest: false - particles render in front of everything\n- depthWrite: false - don't block other particles\n- renderOrder: 0 - render after opaque objects\n- Wireframe particles mixed with solid for texture\n\nCOMMUNICATES WITH:\n- Three.js scene (adds meshes to scene graph)\n- Animation loop (updates position/opacity every frame)\n- No backend communication - pure client-side visual effect\n\nBACKEND STRUCTURE (unchanged in this commit):\n============================================\nThese files handle data persistence and authentication but weren't modified in this commit.\nBackend structure explained for context:\n\n\xf0\x9f\x93\xa1 routes/scenes.js - Scene CRUD API\n------------------------------------\nENDPOINTS:\n1.
