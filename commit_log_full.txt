FRONTEND CHANGES:
================

🎵 useAudioAnalyzer.js - Audio Frequency Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT DOES:
- Analyzes real-time audio to extract frequency data (bass, mids, highs)
- Breaks audio into frequency bands to drive visual effects
- Normalizes audio data to 0-1 range for consistent animations

NEW FEATURES:
- Split bass into sub-bass (20-60Hz - deep kicks) and mid-bass (60-250Hz - toms/bass guitar)
- Weighted combination: sub-bass gets 70% influence (kicks hit harder visually)
- Sharp highs (2000-8000Hz) now focus on transient sounds (snare, hi-hat, claps)
- Filters out sustained high frequencies to emphasize percussive hits

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Web Audio API captures audio stream from user's microphone/audio input
2. AnalyzerNode converts audio to frequency data using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
3. getFrequencyRangeAverage() samples specific Hz ranges and normalizes them
4. Returns { bass, mids, highs, overall } object that components can use

COMMUNICATES WITH:
- Any component that imports useAudioAnalyzer() hook
- Drives particle systems, color changes, animations based on music

🌌 useNebulaParticles.js - Symphonic Particle Motion
-----------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT DOES:
- Creates 200 floating particles that move in synchronized orbital patterns
- Divides particles into 3 groups that move like a symphony orchestra
- Each group has unique motion choreography inspired by Beethoven's 9th Symphony

THE 3 ORCHESTRA SECTIONS:
1. STRINGS (Group 0 - Inner Orbit):
   - Smooth flowing melody like violins playing 'Ode to Joy'
   - Graceful sinusoidal motion with harmonic intervals
   - Tight 8-unit orbit with gentle vertical breathing
   - Slightly more visible (opacity 0.2)

2. BRASS (Group 1 - Middle Orbit):
   - Bold punctuated phrases like horns and trumpets
   - Staccato (stepped) motion with dramatic swells
   - Wide 22-unit orbit with vertical stratification
   - Crescendo/decrescendo opacity changes (forte/piano)

3. TIMPANI (Group 2 - Outer Orbit):
   - Rhythmic pulses like percussion heartbeat
   - Radial bursts that expand/contract on 4/4 beat
   - Far 40-unit orbit with accented 4th beat (boom-boom-boom-BOOM)
   - Sharp attack/decay opacity

MOTION MATHEMATICS:
- Uses sin/cos for circular orbits and figure-8 paths
- Phase offset (unique per particle) prevents clustering
- Multiple frequencies combined (t * 0.25, t * 2, t * 0.5) create harmony
- Squared sine waves (Math.pow) create dramatic crescendos

RENDERING:
- depthTest: false - particles render in front of everything
- depthWrite: false - don't block other particles
- renderOrder: 0 - render after opaque objects
- Wireframe particles mixed with solid for texture

COMMUNICATES WITH:
- Three.js scene (adds meshes to scene graph)
- Animation loop (updates position/opacity every frame)
- No backend communication - pure client-side visual effect

BACKEND STRUCTURE (unchanged in this commit):
============================================
These files handle data persistence and authentication but weren't modified in this commit.
Backend structure explained for context:

📡 routes/scenes.js - Scene CRUD API
------------------------------------
ENDPOINTS:
1. POST /api/scenes - Save new scene
   - Receives: { name, description, config: {...controlValues} }
   - Returns: { success, scene, totalScenes, unlockedNoetechs, unlockedAnimations }
   - Triggers unlock progression system

2. GET /api/scenes/my-scenes - Get user's scenes
   - Returns: { success, count, scenes: [...] }

3. PUT /api/scenes/:id - Update scene
   - Receives: { name?, description?, config? }
   - Returns: { success, scene }

4. DELETE /api/scenes/:id - Delete scene
   - Returns: { success, message }

UNLOCK SYSTEM:
- Scene 1 → unlocks Icarus-X character
- Scene 2 → unlocks Vectra character
- Scene 3 → unlocks Nexus character
- Scene 4 → unlocks Phoenix Dive animation for Icarus-X

📡 routes/auth.js - Authentication API
--------------------------------------
ENDPOINTS:
1. POST /api/auth/signup
   - Receives: { username, email, password }
   - Returns: { success, token, user }

2. POST /api/auth/login
   - Receives: { email, password }
   - Returns: { success, token, user }

3. GET /api/auth/me
   - Returns: { success, user } (requires JWT token)

🔌 services/sceneApi.jsx - Frontend API Client
-----------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS:
- saveScene(sceneData, token) → POST to backend
- deleteScene(sceneId, token) → DELETE request
- getMyScenes(token) → GET user scenes
- updateScene(sceneId, sceneData, token) → PUT update

COMMUNICATION FLOW:
Frontend → sceneApi.jsx → HTTP request → Backend routes → Database → Response → Frontend

EXAMPLE SAVE FLOW:
1. User clicks Save button
2. Frontend calls saveScene({ name, config })
3. sceneApi.jsx sends: fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/scenes', {POST, JWT token})
4. Backend routes/scenes.js receives request
5. Middleware verifies JWT token
6. Creates Scene document in MongoDB
7. Checks unlock progression
8. Returns { scene, unlockedNoetechs }
9. Frontend displays success + unlocked characters

Changes:
- Add createTesseractWithFaces + mergeGeometries import to active helpers
- Update 7 polytope files to import shared function instead of duplicating
- Delete orphaned src/utils/geometryHelpers.js (never imported)
- Fix ThreeScene.jsx import path to use correct helpers location

Impact:
- Removed ~560 lines of duplicate code

5440c4d08e0536bd09688a2f73f70f65cc3ac75d|docs: Add scene state refactoring plan and create useSceneState hook

Created custom hook to extract 20+ scene state variables from App.jsx

New files:
- src/hooks/useSceneState.js - Custom hook with all scene state
- docs/reference/workflows/SCENE_STATE_REFACTOR.md - Complete refactoring guide

Hook organizes state into logical domains:
- Material properties (metalness, emissive, color, wireframe)
- Hyperframe (colors)
- Scene behavior (camera, environment, objects, animation)
- Lighting (ambient + directional)
- Animation (scale, speeds)

Next: Integrate into App.jsx (not yet applied - this commit is prep only)

Integrated useSceneState hook into App.jsx GeomLab component

Changes:
- Modified src/App.jsx to use useSceneState() hook
- Fixed useSceneState.js to return flat object structure with default export
- Replaced 22 individual useState calls with single hook

Benefits:
- Reduced App.jsx complexity (cleaner state management)
- Better state organization (material, hyperframe, scene, lighting, animation)
- Maintains all existing functionality (tested and verified)

Impact:
- All controls work correctly (sliders, colors, camera, geometry)
- Save/load functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to child components
- sceneConfig object construction unchanged

Changes:
- Expanded inline arrow functions in catch handlers to block syntax
- Fixed in SaveControls.jsx, UnlockModal.jsx, AnimationUnlockModal.jsx
